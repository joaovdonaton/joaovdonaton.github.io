                        to improve energy efficiency, accuracy and inference time, in particular for low-power devices and for problems that can
                        take advantage of the temporal event-based nature of SNNs.

                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p class="about-description">
                    I'm an international student at Kent State University (KSU) studying Computer Science with a minor in Applied Math.
                    I've also received a degree in Liberal Arts from KSU as part of a two-year program in partnership with the Brazilian university PUC-PR (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná).
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">
                    My interest in Computer Science began in 2018, when I found out about C# programming through the Unity Game engine. From that, I played around with
                    different tools and languages before deciding that I actually wanted to learn Java thoroughly. I bought a book on Java 8 for beginners, and I got to learn
                    about basic data structures, Object-oriented programming and the Swing API for developing GUIs. I never really stopped learning since then, and have
                    used languages such as Python, C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript, and a range of different frameworks and APIs.
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">
                    While studying for my Liberal Arts degree in Brazil, I had the opportunity of being part of a training and recruitment program for
                    one of Latin America's largest banks, Bradesco. I took part in 9 months of formal in-person training to be a back-end developer at the bank.
                    We used Java (Spring Framework) and Javascript (Node.JS with Express framework) to build REST APIs. Being a part of this was probably the best
                    educational experience I have had until now. I met amazingly talented professors and incredibly hard-working people. I got to learn about
                    proper development patterns and standards, unit testing and documentation, as well as authentication, authorization and many other concepts.
                </p>
                <p class="about-description">
                    Other than that, my interests include reading, playing video games, cooking and metal music.
